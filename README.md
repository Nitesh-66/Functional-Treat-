# Functional Programming Operations in Python

## Introduction

This project is a **menu-driven Python application** that demonstrates the use of **functional programming concepts** along with **built-in Python functions**.
It focuses on performing operations on **1D lists and 2D lists (matrices)** using functions, recursion, lambda expressions, and sorting techniques.

The project is designed to strengthen understanding of **core Python programming** concepts.

## Project Description

The program allows users to:

* Create and manage a **1D list**
* Create and manage a **2D list**
* Perform data analysis using built-in functions
* Apply functional programming techniques such as recursion, lambda functions, and multiple return values

All operations are performed through a **menu-driven interface**, making the program easy to use and understand.

## Functionalities

* Input data for 1D list
* Input data for 2D list
* Display data summary (length, min, max, sum, average)
* Display 2D list in grid format
* Calculate factorial using recursion
* Filter data based on a threshold using lambda function
* Sort 1D list in ascending and descending order
* Sort 2D list using `sorted()`
* Return multiple values from a function
* Display data using `*args` and `**kwargs`

---

## Concepts Used

* Functions and modular programming
* Global variables
* Recursion
* Lambda functions
* Built-in functions (`len`, `max`, `min`, `sum`, `sorted`)
* List operations
* 2D list (matrix) operations
* `*args` and `**kwargs`

## Explanation of Main Functions

* **input_data()**
  Creates and stores 1D and 2D lists based on user input.

* **display_summary()**
  Displays summary of 1D list using built-in functions and prints the 2D list.

* **fact(n)**
  Calculates factorial of a number using recursion.

* **filter_data(n)**
  Filters elements greater than or equal to a given number using lambda function.

* **sort_data()**
  Sorts 1D and 2D lists in ascending or descending order.

* **dataset()**
  Returns minimum, maximum, sum, and average of the 1D list.

* **show_data(*args)**
  Displays values using variable-length arguments.

* **show_data_summary(**kwargs)**
  Displays values using keyword arguments.
